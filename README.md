# How to use graphQL + Apollo with React-native

## Introduction

I wanted to learn graphQL, so I took this great tutorial on [medium.com](https://medium.com/react-native-training/building-chatty-a-whatsapp-clone-with-react-native-and-apollo-part-1-setup-68a02f7e11)

I didn't follow exactly what the tutorial said as I use [expo](https://expo.io) to build the client side. So for the front, the code is slightly different.
